Here is SQL code with CTE to find out  top 5 customers that are based within each country:

                  B.first_name,

                  D.city,
                  SUM(A.amount) AS highest_total_amounts_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id

                COUNT (DISTINCT B.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
	    COUNT (DISTINCT cte_country_of_top5customers) AS top_customer_count
