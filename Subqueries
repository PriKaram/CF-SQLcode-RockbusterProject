## Here is SQL code using subquery to find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers by using multiple joins


SELECT AVG (highest_total_amounts_paid) AS average
FROM
(SELECT B.customer_id, 
               SUM(A.amount) AS highest_total_amounts_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE D.city IN ('Aurora',
                 'Acua',
                 'Citrus Heights',
                 'Iwaki',
                 'Ambattur',
                 'Shanwei',
                 'So Leopoldo',
                 'Teboksary',
                 'Tianjin',
                 'Cianjur')
GROUP BY B.customer_id      
ORDER BY SUM(A.amount) DESC
LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid;
